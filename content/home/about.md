Dongdong Tian is a PhD Candidate in Geophysics at
[University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/).
His supervisor is Prof. [Lianxing Wen](http://geophysics.geo.sunysb.edu/wen/).

His research interests include the structure of the Earth's deep interior
and numerical simulations of seismic wavefield propagation.
He's working on projects of
[fine-scale structure of the Earth's inner core boundary](project/inner-core-boundary).

He's a fan of open source and also contributes to geophysics-related softwares, such as
[GMT](http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/),
[SAC](https://seiscode.iris.washington.edu/projects/sac)
